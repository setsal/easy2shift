Personal practice with vue 

backend is golang, also practice too :|

## Getting Start

### backend
```bash
cd backend && go run app.go
```

backend service will listen on `localhost:3000`

### frontend 
```bash
# clone and enter the project
git clone && cd frontend

# install dependency
yarn install

# develop
yarn dev
```

This will automatically open http://localhost:8000
